# Most of my modern work is on my Homelab I've named Tau! I will add code for it to my GitHub later, but in the meantime I would love to give a code-tour over call to interested parties!

### What I've worked on (so far! ever expanding) to build my hyper-personalized super smart home:

- Agentic, Reasoning AI
    - LLMs (main brain)
    - RAG retrieval (context querying)
    - Database Management (log querying)
    - Computer Vision (image recognition)
    - Self iteration and reinforcement learning
- Machine Learning Infrastructure
    - GPU optimizations (GPUs are expensive, I get the most I can out of mine)
    - Training & Inference Observability
    - Automation Engineering and Tooling
- Data
    - Extracting, Transforming, Loading (I prefer extracting, loading, transforming)
    - Logging and Storage Management
    - Replication and Redundency
    - Visualization, Labeling, Scraping
- Extra tooling for Tau
    - Automated video and image cropping
    - Web scraping
    - Automated memory and context management
    - Anomaly Detection for network and IoT devices
